[12.1s-18.9s] The first strategy is active listening and showing genuine empathy for customer concerns and pain points. [18.9s-25.4s] This involves carefully mirroring their communication style and asking thoughtful, open-ended follow-up questions that demonstrate your understanding. [25.4s-32.1s] The second strategy focuses on understanding customer needs through effective questioning techniques and careful observation of their responses. [32.1s-38.7s] Ask open-ended questions that encourage customers to share their specific challenges and long-term business goals. [38.7s-45.3s] The third strategy involves building trust through consistent follow-through on promises and maintaining regular communication. [45.3s-52.0s] Always deliver on your commitments and keep customers informed about progress and potential issues. [52.0s-58.5s] Remember that trust is built over time through small actions and consistent behavior patterns."""

    Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability.
    
    When people talk about CRM, they are usually referring to a CRM system, a tool that helps with contact management, sales management, agent productivity, and more. CRM tools can now be used to manage customer relationships across the entire customer lifecycle, spanning marketing, sales, digital commerce, and customer service interactions.
    
    A CRM solution helps you focus on your organization's relationships with individual people ‚Äî including customers, service users, colleagues, or suppliers ‚Äî throughout your lifecycle with them, including finding new customers, winning their business, and providing support and additional services throughout the relationship.
